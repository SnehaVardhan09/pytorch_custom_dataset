# pytorch_custom_dataset
find a dataset, turn into numbers, build a model to find patterns in those numbers on custom dataset 

PyTorch includes many existing functions to load in various custom datasets in TorchText, TorchVision, TorchAudio, TorchRec

0. Importing pytorch and setting up device-agnostic code 
1. Get data
2. Become one with the data(Data preparation)
3. Transforming data
4. Loading image data with a custoom dataset
5. other forms of transforms
7. Model 0: TinyVGG without data augmentation
8. Exploring loss curves
9. Model 1: TinyVGG without data augmentation
10.Compare model results
11.Making a prediction on a custom image
